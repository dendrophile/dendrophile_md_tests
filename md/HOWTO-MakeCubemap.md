How do I Make a Cubemap Texture?
================================


<span class=keyword>Cubemaps</span> are used by the [Reflective built-in shaders](shader-reflectivefamily.html). To build one, you either create six 2D textures and create a new Cubemap asset, or build the Cubemap from a single square texture. More details are in the [Cubemap Texture](class-cubemap.html) documentation page.

Static and dynamic cubemap reflections can also be rendered from scripts. Code example in [Camera.RenderToCubemap](scriptref:camera.rendertocubemap.html.html) page contains a simple wizard script for rendering cubemaps straight from the editor.
