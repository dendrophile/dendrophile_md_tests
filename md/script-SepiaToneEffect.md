Sepia Tone image effect
=======================


<span class=keyword>Sepia Tone</span> is a simple image effect that tints an image to resemble an old photograph.

As with the other [image effects](comp-imageeffects.html), this effect is only available in Unity Pro and you must have the [Pro Standard Assets](howto-installstandardassets.html) installed before it becomes available.
