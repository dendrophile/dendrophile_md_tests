Component Details
-----------------


###Physics Control
* [Rigidbody](class-rigidbody.html) - Rigidbodies put objects under physics control.
* [Constant Force](class-constantforce.html) - A utility component that adds a constant force to a rigidbody. Great for rockets and other quick functionality.

###Colliders
* [Sphere Collider](class-spherecollider.html) - use for sphere-shaped objects.
* [Box Collider](class-boxcollider.html) - use for box-shaped objects.
* [Capsule Collider](class-capsulecollider.html) - use for capsule-like (a cylinder with hemisphere ends) objects.
* [Mesh Collider](class-meshcollider.html) - takes the graphical [mesh](class-mesh.html) and uses it as a collision shape.
* [Physic Material](class-physicmaterial.html) - contains settings allowing you to fine-tune your object's physical properties (friction, bounce, etc).

###Joints
* [Hinge Joint](class-hingejoint.html) - Used to make door hinges.
* [Spring Joint](class-springjoint.html) - A spring-like joint.
* [Fixed Joint](class-fixedjoint.html) - Use to "lock" objects together.
* [Configurable Joint](class-configurablejoint.html) - Use create complex joint behaviors of virtually any kind

###Special Function
* [Character Controller](class-charactercontroller.html) and [Character Joint](class-characterjoint.html) - Used to make character controllers.
* [Wheel Collider](class-wheelcollider.html) - A special collider for grounded vehicles.
* [Skinned Cloth](class-skinnedcloth.html) - Used to create Skinned cloth
* [Interactive Cloth](class-interactivecloth.html) - Used to create Interactive cloths, this is just normal cloth being simulated.
